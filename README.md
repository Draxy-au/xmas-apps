## Will's Xmas Apps

I wanted to create a few apps for Xmas, to help my friends and family.

I decided to use Next.js with next-auth and store data with MongoDB.

## Secret Santa

The Secret Santa app will allow users to Create a Secret Santa list.
This will allow them to enter in various Names and associated Email addresses in to a Secret Santa listing.

The listing can be finalised, at which point it will randomly assign members of the Secret Santa listing to other members of the same listing. They can't get themselves, and everyone is assigned.

## Gift List

The Gift List app will allow users to create a list of items they would like, with details on price, where to purchase, etc.

Other uses can then view this list and check off if they have purchased an item or items. The list owner will not see what is checked off, but other members can, so they don't get the same thing.

## Xmas Games

Some games I have made using React with an Xmas theme.
